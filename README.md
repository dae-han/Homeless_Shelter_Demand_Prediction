## Problem Statement

In this project, I built a time series model to forecast the total number of individuals sheltered by the NYC Department of Homeless Services (DHS). I used DHS Daily Report publicly available from [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us) to build Time Series model. I aimed to help understand homeless communities better by examining different factors that change the number of individuals in DHS shelter and to help better prepare for those who are in need of a space at a shelter by forecasting the general demand.
